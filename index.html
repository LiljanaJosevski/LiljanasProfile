								<p>Hi, my name is Liljana Josevski, I am 33 years old, and I have been married to Jason for 12 years, we have three beautiful daughters, Milla, 9 years old, Eva, 7 years old and Eden, 4 years old. We also have a white English Staffy named JoJo and an auburn domestic cat named Simba. They are an unlikely pair but are best of friends. My student Number is s3909588 and student email is s3909588@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
								
								<p>I have been a hairdresser for 14 years as hair dressing runs in my family, my mum was a hairdresser, my auntie, my sister and many of my cousins so, hairdressing came very naturally to me. I have come to a point in my life where I need to think about going back to work as all my kids will be in primary school as of next year. My husband has his own company and concentrates on managed services and server upgrades also does some contract work for Ambulance Victoria and the state government. I want to become experienced and confident in the IT field so I could be able to assist my husband and potentially work alongside him. </p>

							<h3>Interest IN I.T-</h3>
						<p>My interest in technology started as a child. I had a Nintendo and shared an Atari with my brother and sister. As I grew older, I started to download my own music. My husband is a Systems Engineer and we as a family are very tech savvy, always need to have the latest tech gadget. So, when the very first iPhone came out in 2007, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2604020/the-evolution-of-apples-iphone.html"> page 1, April Montgomery and Ken Mingis, Computerworld, 16 October 2020, 20/3/2021</a>  we were first out of our friends and family to own one and we bought one of the first wireless console to make an impact to the gaming industry, which was the Nintendo Wii in 2006. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nintendo-Wii"> page 1, The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 23/01/2017</a> 
				  </p>
				<p>As we had our children, we noticed technology has really blown up and everything is revolved around technology. Our kids are born knowing how to use a touch screen device. I remember when I first saw the iPad, it was something amazing, now we cannot imagine life without technology. Our children know how to navigate the internet through laptops, iPad, PCs, can download apps, use servers to connect with friends to play their online games, connect to a hotspot to access internet when not connected to wi-fi. Technology has really come extremely far from black and white TV sets being invented in the early 20th century, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_television"> page 1, History of television, 20/03/2021</a>  to now having the internet easily accessible just with a touch of a button on our TV remote controls, we can access YouTube or Netflix or even on our mobile devices. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming">page 1, The Verge, Chaim Gartenberg, Apr 24,The Netflix button is an advertisement masquerading as a product, 2020,20/03/2021</a></p>
			<p>Technology has become a household essential. Google home has also become an essential part of our everyday living from us asking her for the weather to the kids asking her a random question or what the meaning is of a particular word. Also, radio has improved now attaining digital radio and my favourite, cloud storage. I have got hundreds of thousands of photos that I can access with an internet connection, I feel it is priceless. I find technology fascinating for the fact it helps our everyday living and quality of life from, in the kitchen, for e.g., air fryers, blenders, dishwashers etc. to even helping people medically e.g., pacemakers, bionic limbs etc. I would love to be able to help humanity with technology by creating a product or app one day and make a real difference in the world for the better.  </p>
		<p>My husband being in IT sparked my interest as he always needed to be up to date with all the technology available and so our family is very tec savvy, including our children. We tend to download movies and back when there was no Spotify, we would also download our music. I have created websites through WIX. I love editing my photos using Lightroom and using social media accounts such as Facebook and Instagram, browsing the web and online shopping. I know how to use all the basic and essential technologies with ease. Also, my children watch ‘Barbie’s Dreamhouse’ episodes and Barbie’s mother is an IT Engineer that invents amazing products to use around the home which I found amazing and intriguing to see a female in IT. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU853AU853&sxsrf=ALeKk02iJoBsxEWmQDV3FM1Up-9LZXDoLg:1616054203641&q=barbie+dreamhouse+adventures+season+1+episode+1&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NExPs8ioqEqzUIJw00zLDMzSjHK1pLKTrfRLyoAovqAoP70oMdcqtSCzOD8ltfgR4ypGboGXP-4JSy1gnLTm5DXGmYxceNQL6XGxueaVZJZUCqlwCUqh2qvBIMXPheYUZyOTXZemnWPTE5Ra9f9_Y1-Ig5Iipw2v_oFPp1_ZC1pX_bsf-MzCQYJFgUGDwfCRJavD-imMB7QYDjAyNe1bcYiNhYNRgMGKSYOpiomDiWcRq35SYlFSZqpCSlFqYm5GfmlxqkJiSllqXklpUWqxQnFqYnF-noKhAtS5CoYAulJYnRwBAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizqPuFr7nvAhXO8HMBHfQuDKQQri4wXHoFCAEQlQE"> Google search, page 1, Barbie Dreamhouse AdventuresEpisodesS01 E01 · Welcome to the Dreamhouse, 20/03/2021 </a></p>
	<p>I decided to study at RMIT as I need a career change. Being a hairdresser for 14 years and now having school aged children I need to make myself available for them when they need me such as, school drop off, school pick up, after school activities and I do not think that working weekends and nights that a shopping centre applies would suit my priorities. I find I.T would give me the flexibility to work from home and considering my husband is already in I.T I believe it is a better fit for me professionally and financially. Although I love doing hair as a hobby, technology is the future. </p>
<p>Throughout my studies at RMIT I hope to learn I.T terminologies in depth and to be able to understand with confidence about operating systems to be able to work alongside my husband in his business if not even more. I aim to help my Husband grow his business to create good foundations for our children if they chose to take over someday, as I believe they would be considering our family dynamics already are very technical. Starting this course has opened my eye to the unlimited possibilities technology can provide. This has shown me that with a great idea we can create life changing products or apps to help humanities survival being health or lifestyle. Biology and the human body are big interest of mine so if I could possibly create a product or technology to assist in our health and survival would be a dream comes true. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/big family.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>16 Personalities-</h3>
								<p>The first personality test I used was 16 personalities. These results were that I’m a protagonist - ENFJ-T <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/f33a78bb4a9b1"> 2011-2021 NERIS Analytics Limited, Liljana Josevski, 20/03/2021</a>  this shows me that I am extroverted and eager to work in teams, I am enthusiastic, influential, genuine, I am success-driven, perfectionistic eager to improve. Also comparing ourselves to others can sometimes create an uneasy feeling of regret. But I can admit I am learning not to compare and instead feel genuine happiness because I do not like that feeling of regret. I do agree with these statements, though, I am surprised that the result show that I am an extroverted leader. I find that over time I have become this type of person willingly but not born with these traits. As a child I was incredibly shy and doing hairdressing has made me grow as a person. Also being a mother to three strong girls has made me become more resilient and has helped form my personality. I guess our life experiences makes us the people we become. Many other specific factors have probably contributed to my personality such as losing my mother as a teenager, my father also getting cancer, I guess what does not kill you makes you stronger. <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWhat_does_not_kill_me_makes_me_stronger&h=AT17vv0r5zjiww0sDay1d2dGt5x542coPSo4JgAmqFc7MFs6iTuejG1_kKta_G97BcVnSuEvk8vjacasWYR4Bir9zsws1PtnxV1SUx-MX5DmRiTrvaNGZHVwNTShRdelNTfjvbXdiseuMkc&s=1"> What does not kill me makes me stronger, Rodw, 30/01/2021, 20/03/2021</a></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/16 Personalities.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Personality Perfect-</h3>
								<p>In the personality perfect test shows a similar result, that I’m also an ENFJ-The Giver <a href="https://www.personalityperfect.com/test/free-personality-test/3te3b572726d0bd33ac2136f55ffd34114e32"> personality Perfect, Personality profile,20/03/2021</a> ) the results were quite similar with the 16 personality test, surprisingly. It amazed me to see that with these two tests, they have shown such similar personality traits such as, Influential, loyal, reliable, genuinely kind, highly intuitive and reflective, warm, caring, generous, people-focused and a good communicator. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personality perfect 1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>DISC Personality Test-</h3>
								<p>According to the DISC personality test, <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/159/result/13094112"> Truity, DISC Personality Assessment, MARCH 14, 2021</a>  as do the other two previous tests, shows my behavioural style is an influence style. My focus in group work is getting people motivated and working together. Influence styles are being self-confident and upbeat. We are enthusiastic collaborators and love to bring people together. I do agree with these statements, I try and be the best version of myself and I am proud to be me. I love being around groups of family and friends as it energises me.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Disc influencer.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Although I am happy with my overall personality test results, after completing the three personality tests I believe they show a similar result which indicate to me they are quite accurate in determining my personality traits. When working in teams we should probably look for different types of personalities to balance each other out, although that might mean we are all quite different and might clash, which would potentially create conflict, so maybe grouping up with similar personalities could be better as we will have more in common. The character traits that I appreciate are communication, patience and perseverance. I believe with these you will always be on the same level and issues will always be spoken about and not assumed or fought over. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/milla .jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Overview-</h3>
								<p>My project idea is creating an application or programme that you can download on to your device that will be used online or with images saved to your photo album. It would be used in conjunction with online shopping for clothing and accessories. The application will help you decide whether to purchase an item of clothing or accessory by seeing it virtually on yourself. It will be simple to use and by supplying a detailed profile with accurate measurements, you will be able to see the prospected item of clothing or accessory on yourself virtually, before deciding to make the purchase. This app could also be used with existing clothes you already have, to organise potential future outfits or just simply to see if your outfit will match. I aim to create this app to be used by anyone without any tech experience just like you would any other app. It will be consumer friendly and very secure and be assured your data is protected. Having the convenience to virtually try on selected clothes and accessories would be a game changer in the online shopping world. </p>
								<h3>Motivation-</h3>
								<p>I, like most other females and males, do online shopping <a href="https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/">Online Shopping Statistics You Need to Know in 2021, Coral Ouellette on January 6, 2021, 20/03/2021</a> and sometimes make the wrong decision when making an online purchase, may it be because the item does not suit me because it looked better on the model or because I was not sure which size to get, so I would buy the wrong size, either being too big or too small. This application should help take the stress out of regretful online purchases by eliminating the unknowns and creating more of an expected result. I believe the app will make online shopping easier and more enjoyable for the consumer. It will give you a virtual feeling of shopping without the hassle that regular retail shopping entails such as having to drive and find parking, having to try on garments and undress multiple times and wait in que to be served. Also, if people have young children this task can serve to be impossible, so, usually online is the best solution, it is in the comfort, and safety of your own home.  

								</p>
								<h3>Description-</h3>
								<p>My idea of this application will work quite simply, you will be required to take a clear photo of yourself in modest undergarments and add all required measurements in the profile such as height, weight, BMI (body mass index)- which can be calculated, <a href="https://www.diabetes.ca/managing-my-diabetes/tools---resources/body-mass-index-(bmi)-calculator#:~:text=Body%20Mass%20Index%20is%20a,most%20adults%2018%2D65%20years"> March 19, 2021Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator, 20/03/2021</a> bust, waist and hips measurements.( There could possibly be an option of just a photo of your face if you would prefer, and then in conjunction with your specified body measurements there would be an avatar created as your body type).  As you select to go onto your chosen online shopping site, you will find a button linking the app to the selected online store which will redirect you out of the app. You will be advised to save the image or take a snapshot of the selected garment and with the technology in the app it will automatically cut around the perimeter of the garment and apply it to your profile picture. You will then be able to see the chosen garment in your selected size, in conjunction with the specified sizing of the garment, on the website and stretch elements put into consideration. Then, the garment will be applied to your virtual self and here you will be able to determine whether you are satisfied to then purchase the item of clothing or accessory. Try before you buy as people say. I believe this is a great theory and deter you leaving the comfort of your own home. Hopefully, you will not be surprised with any regretful purchases. The app will also be utilized with your existing clothing, the only difference here would be that the garment will need to be photographed flat on a blank background, so the app can acknowledge it. </p>
								<h3>Tool and Technologies-</h3>
								<p>The tools and technologies to create this project idea would require software development, software design, database development using SDK (software developmental kits) and API (application programming interface) <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-API-work-with-a-database"> Quora, How does an API work with a database?, 20/03/2021</a> in which it will be more personalised and also using SPC (software processing control) which will allow the input of personal data. <a href="https://www.definitions.net/definition/data+processing+system#:~:text=The%20software%20data%20processing%20system,of%20other%20information%20processing%20subsystems."> Definitions, Data Processing System, 20/03/2021</a> Ideally the app would be a Native app to create a better UX (User Experience) with quick navigation and enhancing the security of the user’s data. <a href="https://www.upwork.com/resources/native-hybrid-web-app-differences?vt_cmp=11384804789&vt_adg=113089129402&vt_src=google&vt_kw=&vt_device=c&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=11384804789&utm_medium=paidsearch&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0caCBhCIARIsAGAfuMwbSsx2jvZPeZ36kp85MpJuDiB6HaRQkn4tPAmVPVD4SweoW4hywcQaAtDSEALw_wcB"> Upwork, Native vs. Hybrid vs. Web App: What's the Difference?,20/03/2021</a> Also  another advantage of using a native apps is, the camera will be accessed, which is one of the main functions in using the app also being able to interact with the devices operating system with GUI (graphical user interface) <a href=”https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface”> Omnisci, Graphical User Interface,20/03/2021</a> and CLI (command line interface) when inputting the user’s specific measurements. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface,"> Command-line interface, 19/03/2021, Wikipedia, 19/03/2021</a>  You would need an Apple mac to work on for the iOS version and usually Windows for the Android version. An iPhone and Android phone will also be needed to test the app on after it is created. You can download XCode, which is open source to develop Apple iOS apps, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/BuildABasicUI.html">  2018 Apple Inc., Build a basic UI, 20/03/2021</a> and Android Studio for Android apps, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/intro"> Developers, , Meet Android Studio, 2021-02-24, Brand guides, 20/03/2021</a>  which can be created on Windows devices. A database which will store all the users details including their measurements, profile picture and garments selected, will also be required within the app, this will require SDK and API. The app will be required to allow access to the photo album on the device or you can take a photo with access to your camera. You will also be able to access links to specific shopping websites directly from the app <a href="https://www.elegantmedia.com.au/blog/everything-need-know-app-links-mobile-app-equivalent-website-urls/"> Elegant Media 2021,  Everything You Need To Know About ‘App Links’: The Mobile App URLs Equivalent Of Website URLs, 20/03/2021</a> using Universal Resource Identifiers (URI) and enable app links which are open source too. </p>
								<h3>Skills Required-</h3>
								<p>The skills that this app would require are software programming language using Java Script for an Android app and Swift coding language for Apple apps. In order to create an Apple iOS app, you can use any Mac device and install the XCode programme which uses the swift coding language, making sure you are using the latest updated version of your Mac OS software before starting. There are templates in the app you can use. Here is where the app is designed, the UI (user interface) in the storyboard section. You will need images to use, which you can find free icons in the Icon Store <a href="https://iconstore.co/">  2021 IconStore, Free Icons by First-Class Designers, 20/03/2021</a>  to add to your app’s GUI, this way preventing copy writing if you do not have originals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUQz9ZWjsvc"> App Development Tutorial | How to Make An iOS APP - Angela Yu, Mar 7, 2018, 20/03/2021</a> If you want to make them from on your own, you can use Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch. <a  href="https://99designs.com.au/blog/web-digital/how-to-design-app-icons/">  workerbee 3 years ago,99designsby Vistaprint, How to design an app icon: the ultimate guide, 20/03/2021 </a></p>
								<h3>Outcome-</h3>
								<p>I predict my app idea could become a big hit especially for women around the world. There have been numerous times when I’ve been shopping online and I have been so indecisive on whether to purchase the item or not, and usually do, but then regret it. In some cases, I have returned or exchanged the item, but in other cases I have found it too hard and time consuming to then go through the process of returns or exchange, so I am left with the unwanted garment hanging in my closet, collecting dust. I believe this app could revolutionise the online shopping world and the way we know it today. It could even save you time getting ready in the mornings as you have the option of pre organising outfit options with your existing clothes. Therefore, if this app is successful, it will create a new way of shopping that will not only save time but also money from unsuccessful purchases. By being able to see your prospected purchase virtually on yourself would potentially prevent the stress caused by unwanted purchases and help you spend your time the way you choose.</p>
